      <title>Generate RSS Feed for All Languages in Hugo</title>

      <description>Hugo supports multilingual sites natively, and it generates a RSS feed for each sub-site of different language. However, it seems that there are no easy ways to generate a global feed that includes all articles in all sub-sites. Therefore, I wrote a simple Python script to solve the problem.
Basically, it grabs all feeds and merges them into a single feed.
Firstly, I use lxml to load and parse the RSS feeds.</description>

      <description>Previously I have written about 在Ubuntu 安裝 TensorFlow 的紀錄 (Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu). Years have passed, and even though Ubuntu is still on 16.04，TensorFlow has already made great progress. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write another post to show how to install TensorFlow and Caffe with Anaconda. GPU</description>

      <title>Using Caffe for Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://city.shaform.com/en/2015/06/06/caffe-sentiment-analysis/</link>

      <description>Caffe is a deep learning framework that can be used to develop neural network models. Although Caffe is usually used for image classification, it does not prevent us from utilizing it for other tasks. In this article, we outline the procedure to convert Paragraph Vectors into the LMDB format that Caffe understands, and create a simple model to train and predict the sentiment for movie reviews.
Data Preparation While in the previous post we use custom Chinese corpus for sentiment analysis, this time we utilize the scripts provided by mesnilgr/iclr15 to download the Large Movie Review Dataset so it&amp;rsquo;s easier to reproduce the results.</description>

      <title>Notes about Migrating from Qwerty to Dvorak</title>

      <description>Windows Newer versions of Windows could use different keyboard layouts for the login screen. Just choose it when installing or add the relevant input method in language settings.
Linux Newer versions of Linux distributions also support dvorak layout when installing.
If you want to set the layout temporarily, you could also use the following commands:
setxkbmap dvorak # change to dvorak setxkbmap us # change back to qwerty Xrdp If you are using rdp to connect to remote linux servers, the keyboard layout is controlled by a separate configuration file.</description>
