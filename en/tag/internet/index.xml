      <description>Last time, I explored the idea of designing a web browsing UI that reduces the possibility of distractions in 〈Single-minded : an Internet reader, made for readers, made by readers〉.

      <description>Realization I&amp;rsquo;ve known it for a long time that it’s difficult for me to read long articles on the web. I thought it’s because of the screen. It made my eyes get tired so easily. However, when I started to read The Shallows written by Nicholas Carr, I realized that it’s not only the screen. The Internet itself is distracting.
I started to remember that, I often clicked between different tabs aimlessly.</description>
