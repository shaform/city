      <description>Back in 2014, I migrated my blogs to Pelican. While there were many static site generators to choose from, the reason I chose Pelican was twofold. Firstly, I was influenced by my friend who used Pelican. Secondly, I had been using Python for some time and therefore I liked the fact that Pelican was developed with Python.
Years have passed. It appears that my friend is no longer using Pelican for her blog.</description>
