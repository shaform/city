      <description>Back in 2014, I migrated my blogs to Pelican. While there were many static site generators to choose from, the reason I chose Pelican was twofold. Firstly, I was influenced by my friend who used Pelican. Secondly, I had been using Python for some time and therefore I liked the fact that Pelican was developed with Python.
Years have passed. It appears that my friend is no longer using Pelican for her blog.</description>

      <description>Hugo supports multilingual sites natively, and it generates a RSS feed for each sub-site of different language. However, it might be desirable to generate a global feed that includes all articles in all sub-sites.
One possibility is to define a custom output format for homepage in config.toml:
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;RSS&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;FEED&amp;#34;] [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.&amp;#34;application/rss&amp;#34;] suffixes = [&amp;#34;xml&amp;#34;] [outputFormats] [outputFormats.FEED] mediatype = &amp;#34;application/rss&amp;#34; baseName = &amp;#34;feed&amp;#34; In layouts/index.feed.xml, we then use the following range loop to iterate though all pages in all languages:</description>
