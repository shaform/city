  <p>I seldom went out for dinner due to the location of school and the lack
of money when I was in NCTU. But since I have came to Taipei, I started
to have opportunities to dine together with others. Once I went with
a lot of people, when it comes to  paying, everyone put her money on the
table.  But the person who collected the money and payed for us later
found out the money was not enough. However, nobody was sure who was
responsible for that. I also have lost 200-300 dollar once when I went out
with others.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we are unable to pay individually, it&rsquo;s often risky to
dine together. There are four problems that might arise: (1) some
people might pay less than required (2) there might may fake money
(3) the restaurant could also make mistakes with the amount of money
(4) some friends might quickly take away his money when the store gives
you your change, making it hard to confirm the amount.</p>
<p>Even though it might be possible to prepare the change beforehand so
I can also pay the exact amount for myself, it&rsquo;s still easy to forget
about it. So I start to wonder whether there could be a payment system
that could solve all the problems.</p>
<p>It basically works as follows. After dining, we could create a dining
event with this app and add everybody. Each person could enter his amount
and the system would check has balance and pay the amount to the friend
who are going to pay physically. The system also displays the total
amount so you could check the change from the store easily.</p>
<p>You could also take a picture with the your receipt so you could check
who does not pay enough when you later find out the money is not enough.</p>
<p>Because all the communication happens on the platform, all friends could
see your dispute, making it easy to pressure the one responsible to
pay back.</p>
<p>If he really does not want to correct the amount, you could give him
a bad review, so when he go out with others next time, everyone could
be aware of this.</p>
<p>Of course, if the system could just pay to the restaurant, then all of
this is not required.</p>
<p>This payment system may utilize peer pressure to promote their apps, so
they can make everyone uses the system and make money.</p>
